# FFTNetNELE-tensorflow-implementation
This repositary provides a tensorflow implementation of the FFTNet intelligibility enhancement model presented in {}. In which, FFTNet is trained as a student network to learn the intelligibility modifications from SSDRC teacher module. Resulting to a noise robust intelligibility modification of innput speech.
Both causal and non-causal versions were experimented in the paper and were found non-causal architecture is robust
